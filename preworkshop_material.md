# PRE-WORKSHOP MATERIAL

The 2022 PIRE Omics Workshop goes straight into analyzing genomic data and assumes participants already have a basic understanding of UNIX, the command line, and HPC environments. You should also have a GitHub account that is set-up with 2-factor authentication.

If you don't have this background, please complete the first UNIX lesson and read the Slurm document. If you do have this background, please check that you are familiar with all the following material.

---

## 1. Unix Shell

The following 2 resources overlap in content, but the first gives a genomics perspective. The first resource is required for participants with no UNIX experience.

1. [Intro to the Command Line for Genomics](http://datacarpentry.github.org/shell-genomics/)
2. [The Unix Shell Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

## 2. HPC

We will be working on the Old Dominion University (ODU) High Performance Computing Cluster (HPC). ***Please make sure to read the Slurm document below*** and read the other information as time allows.

1. [ODU's HPC Slurm](https://wiki.hpc.odu.edu/slurm)
2. [ODU's HPC Cluster](https://wiki.hpc.odu.edu/)
    * You do not need to do any set-up or exercises here.

## 3. Git

In preparation for the workshop, you only need to have a GitHub account and have set-up 2-factor authentication. If you want more Git information, here are some further links:

1. https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
2. https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/

## 4. R

The workshop assumes you have NO previous experience with R. However, learning R during the workshop will be easier if you go through these lessons prior.

1. [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
2. [Programming with R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
